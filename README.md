## About

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s behavior used by socially conscious investors to screen potential investments. Environmental criteria consider how a company safeguards the environment, including corporate policies addressing climate change, for example. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.

With this, the application aims at transparency and agility in communication, making the company reach ESG standards as quickly as possible.

The project is focused on meeting general ESG-related needs by providing feedback and requests between employees and bosses.

After the user (Employee) completes the feedback registration, if he wants to put his e-mail, the system will send an e-mail containing a standard message for each ESG subject

The system administrator will be able to activate others and will also be able, in the future, to control the standard messages that the e-mail sends as soon as the user finishes registering a feedback.

the application contains a google login and also provides a quick integration with any other application

The app has public and private [api](https://github.com/Abbade/esg-api) to help integrate the system
